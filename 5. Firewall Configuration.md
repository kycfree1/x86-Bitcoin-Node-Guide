## Dojo Node Guide. *Part 5, Firewall Configuration*.

**Prerequisites.**
 - [ ] Completed "*Dojo Node Guide*", Parts 1-4.

Uncomplicated Firewall, or UFW, is a simple-to-use, command-line-based application for working with a Linux system’s firewall.

Install UFW.

```bash
sudo apt install ufw -y
```
To ensure that the only ports open are those essential to the nodes normal operation, the following UFW rules should be applied in the terminal.

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
```
```bash
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```
```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
```
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8899/tcp
```
```bash
sudo ufw allow 28334/tcp
```
```bash
sudo ufw allow 28333/tcp
```
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8332/tcp
```
```bash
sudo ufw allow 50002/tcp
```
```bash
sudo ufw allow 4080/tcp
```
```bash
sudo ufw enable
```
When enabling UFW a warning may appear informing that enabling UFW may cause connection issues with the session. Since a rule allowing SSH was already applied, it’s safe to confirm with “y”.

**Proceed to part 6, Installing Package Updates.**
