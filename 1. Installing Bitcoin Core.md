## Dojo Node Guide. *Part 1, Installing Bitcoin Core*.

**Prerequisites.**
 - [ ] Intel/AMD 64-bit computer with [Debian](https://www.debian.org/download) installed.
 - [ ] Minimum 1 Terabyte NVMe/SSD storage.
 - [ ] Minimum 8 Gigabytes RAM.
 - [ ] Reliable internet connection & power supply.

 First, create the Bitcoin user "satoshi".

 ```bash
sudo adduser satoshi
```
Create a strong password for the user, avoiding special characters. Hit enter on the prompts, leaving all at default.

Provide "satoshi" with sudo permissions.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo satoshi
```
Login as the new system user using the user password created previously.

```bash
su - satoshi
```
Run a system upgrade.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
Install required dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt install curl gpg unzip tor -y
```
Create a downloads directory.

```bash
mkdir ~/downloads
```
Enter the directory.

```bash
cd ~/downloads
```
Visit [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/) and locate the page for the most current Bitcoin version, avoiding releases marked "test". At the time of writing, v25 is the most recent release.

Copy the URL for the latest "x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz" package and download using "wget".

```bash
wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0/bitcoin-25.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```
On the same page, download the "SHA256SUMS" file.

```bash
wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0/SHA256SUMS
```
Then download "SHA256SUMS.asc".

```bash
wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0/SHA256SUMS.asc
```
Verify the checksum of the download.

```bash
sha256sum --ignore-missing --check SHA256SUMS
```
The output should show an "ok" message, for example:- "bitcoin-25.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz: OK".

Verify the validity of the release by checking the signatures against the known [developer keys](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs/tree/main/builder-keys) from the official Core repository. 

Import developer keys to GPG keyring.

```bash
curl -L https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs/tarball --output bitcoin-builders.tgz && tar --strip-components=1 -xzvf bitcoin-builders.tgz --wildcards --no-anchored "bitcoin-core-guix.sigs-*/builder-keys" && gpg --import builder-keys/* && rm bitcoin-builders.tgz && rm -r builder-keys
```
Verify the signatures.

```bash
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
```
This will output a series of signature checks for each public key that signed the checksums. The keys previously imported into your keyring should show a "gpg: Good signature" message.

Do not worry about "This key is not certified with a trusted signature!" warnings. Enhanced trust levels have not been manually set for the imported keys.

Remove the downloaded verification files.

```bash
rm SHA256SUMS && rm SHA256SUMS.asc
```
Unpackage Bitcoin Core.

```bash
tar xzf bitcoin-*-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```
Remove the archive.

```bash
rm -r bitcoin-*-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```
Install Bitcoin Core.

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bitcoin-*/bin/*
```
Remove the leftover folder.

```bash
rm -r bitcoin-*/
```
Start the Bitcoin daemon. The initial block download will begin.

```bash
bitcoind -daemon
```
Create a Bitcoin configuration file.

```bash
nano ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
```
Paste the following lines into the file.

```bash
server=1
txindex=1
daemon=1
pruned=0
rpcport=8332
rpcbind=0.0.0.0
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcallowip=10.0.0.0/8
rpcallowip=172.0.0.0/8
rpcallowip=192.0.0.0/8
zmqpubrawblock=tcp://0.0.0.0:28332
zmqpubrawtx=tcp://0.0.0.0:28333
zmqpubhashblock=tcp://0.0.0.0:28334
whitelist=127.0.0.1
peerbloomfilters=1
```
Leave the file open and start a new terminal session. SSH in and download the raw "[rpcauth.py file](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py)" from the Bitcoin repository.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/master/share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py
```
Set the correct file permissions.

```bash
chmod +x rpcauth.py
```
Run the following command, replacing "password" with a strong RPC password. Avoid the use of special characters.

```bash
./rpcauth.py bitcoin password
```
Copy the RPC string, starting "rpcauth=bitcoin", and paste it, including the long string of numbers that follow, to the bottom of the "bitcoin.conf" file, still open in your first terminal window.

Save and exit the file with  "control+x" and confirm with "y" then "enter".

Remove the "rpcauth.py" file.

```bash
rm rpcauth.py
```
Stop Bitcoin CLI.

```bash
bitcoin-cli stop
```
Create a service file to start Bitcoin automatically on system boot.

```bash
cd /etc/systemd/system/
```
Copy the link to the raw "[bitcoind.service](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/25.x/contrib/init/bitcoind.service)" file from the Bitcoin repo.

```bash
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/25.x/contrib/init/bitcoind.service
```
Open the downloaded file.

```bash
sudo nano bitcoind.service
```
Make the following edits.

```bash
####change
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bitcoind -daemonwait \
                            -pid=/run/bitcoind/bitcoind.pid \
                            -conf=/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf \
                            -datadir=/var/lib/bitcoind
##to
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/bitcoind -daemon \
                      -pid=/run/bitcoind/bitcoind.pid \
                      -conf=/home/satoshi/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf \
                      -datadir=/home/satoshi/.bitcoin
####comment out
ExecStartPre=/bin/chgrp bitcoin /etc/bitcoin

##like so
#ExecStartPre=/bin/chgrp bitcoin /etc/bitcoin

####edit
User=bitcoin
Group=bitcoin

##to
User=satoshi
Group=satoshi

####comment out

##like so
#ProtectHome=true
```
Save the file & exit.

Enable the service file.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable bitcoind
```
Start Bitcoin CLI.

```bash
sudo systemctl start bitcoind
```
Before continuing, wait until the initial block download completes. IBD speeds vary depending on bandwidth but can be completed as quickly as 24 hours.

Monitor progress by running the following command from the home directory.

```bash
tail -f .bitcoin/debug.log
```
Once logs show “progress=1.000000“, IBD is complete.

**Configuring Tor**

Open the "torrc" file.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
```
Paste the following to the bottom of the file, then save and exit.

```bash
# Hidden Service Bitcoind
ControlPort 9051
CookieAuthentication 1
CookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1
```
Restart the Tor daemon.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart tor
```
Add your Bitcoin user to the Tor group.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG debian-tor satoshi
```
Configure "bitcoin.conf" for Tor-only network connections.

```bash
nano ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
```
Paste the following lines at the bottom.

```bash
# Hidden Service Bitcoind
proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
listen=1
bind=127.0.0.1
onlynet=onion
```
The first Tor peer needs to be manually added. Leave "bitcoin.conf" open, then visit the Tor node page at  [Bitnodes.io](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/?q=tor) in a web browser. 

Select an active node from the list and copy the Tor address and port number.

Return to the terminal and paste the address at the bottom of the "bitcoin.conf" file. As shown in the example below, include the "addnode=" prefix.

```bash
addnode=ufi6x4yympldoxmzgszvq5pb3pzixelxicvrhssrmky23f5bgxfxlfqd.onion:8333
```
**Note:** This example is not an active node and should not be used.

Save and exit the file, then reboot the node.

```bash
sudo reboot
```
Wait a few minutes, then SSH into the node as "satoshi".

Now check that the node is successfully connecting to Tor peers.

```bash
bitcoin-cli getconnectioncount
```
If the output shows several peers,  you can return to "bitcoin.conf" and remove the entire "addnode" line, then save and exit.

```bash
nano .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
```
Restart the Bitcoin CLI.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart bitcoind
```
Wait a few minutes, then check that you are still connecting to Tor nodes.

```bash
bitcoin-cli getconnectioncount
```
Confirm network traffic is only passing through Tor. The output should show a "reachable false" status for both "IPV4" and "IPV6". Also, confirm that "onion" shows a "reachable true" status.

```bash
bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo
```
The output also displays your Bitcoin Core onion address. This is useful for services requiring a direct connection to Core. 

You can also make direct requests for your Bitcoin onion address.

```bash
bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo | grep address.*onion
```
Bitcoin Core is now successfully installed, synchronised and is configured with Tor.

**Updating Bitcoin Core**

Package updates can be monitored on the official [Bitcoin Core repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases).

Check what version of Core is currently installed with the following command.

```bash
bitcoin-cli --version
```
If a newer version is available, stop Bitcoin CLI.

```bash
bitcoin-cli stop
```
Visit [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/) and locate the page for the most current Bitcoin version, avoiding any releases marked "test".

Enter the downloads directory.

```bash
cd ~/downloads
```
Copy the URL for the latest "x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz" package and download it using "wget". The following command can be edited to include the required version number.

```bash
wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.0/bitcoin-0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```
Download the releases matching verification files. The following commands can be edited to include the required version number.

```bash
wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.0/SHA256SUMS
```
```bash
wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.0/SHA256SUMS.asc
```
Verify the checksum of the download.

```bash
sha256sum --ignore-missing --check SHA256SUMS
```
The output should show an "ok" message, for example:- "bitcoin-25.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz: OK".

Verify the signatures. The developer keys previously imported should show a "gpg: Good signature" message.

```bash
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
```
Unpack the downloaded archive.

```bash
tar xzf bitcoin-*-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```
Remove the verification files and empty archive.

```bash
rm SHA256SUMS && rm SHA256SUMS.asc
```
```bash
rm -r bitcoin-*-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```
Install the new Core package.

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bitcoin-*/bin/*
```
Start Bitcoin Core.

```bash
sudo systemctl start bitcoind
```
Remove the remaining folder.

```bash
rm -r bitcoin-*/
```
Check that the latest version of Bitcoin Core is installed.

```bash
bitcoin-cli --version
```
To confirm that everything is operating as expected, check the logs from the home directory.

```bash
tail -f .bitcoin/debug.log
```
