## Dojo Node Guide. *Part 2, Installing Fulcrum Indexer*.

**Prerequisites.**
 - [ ] Completed "*Dojo Node Guide*," Part 1.

After fully synchronizing Bitcoin Core, installing an Electrum indexer, which ensures compatibility with all Electrum-based Bitcoin wallets, is the next step.

Connecting wallets directly to a personal Electrum server, rather than Core, provides vast security improvements since Core stores balances and public keys unencrypted on the local device.

The Fulcrum Electrum indexer has a larger footprint than other indexers; however, its performance is unmatched once fully synchronized.

Go to the downloads directory.

```bash
cd ~/downloads
```
In a browser, visit [Fulcrum’s Github page](https://github.com/cculianu/Fulcrum/releases) and copy the link for the latest “_x86_64-linux.tar.gz_” file. At the time of writing, the most recent version is 1.9.7.

Download Fulcrum.

```bash
torsocks wget https://github.com/cculianu/Fulcrum/releases/download/v1.9.7/Fulcrum-1.9.7-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
```
Download the releases "asc" file.

```bash
torsocks wget https://github.com/cculianu/Fulcrum/releases/download/v1.9.7/Fulcrum-1.9.7-shasums.txt.asc
```
Download the release's sha256sum file.

```bash
torsocks wget https://github.com/cculianu/Fulcrum/releases/download/v1.9.7/Fulcrum-1.9.7-shasums.txt
```
Verify Fulcrum's checksum.

```bash
sha256sum -c --ignore-missing Fulcrum-*-shasums.txt
```
The output should provide an “OK” message.

Import Fulcrum's developer's [public key](https://github.com/Electron-Cash/keys-n-hashes/blob/master/pubkeys/calinkey.txt) from the official GitHub repository.

```bash
torsocks curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Electron-Cash/keys-n-hashes/master/pubkeys/calinkey.txt | gpg --import
```
Verify the signatures match. The output should read “Good signature from Calin Culianu“.

```bash
gpg --verify Fulcrum-*-shasums.txt.asc
```
Do not worry about the "This key is not certified with a trusted signature!" warning. Enhanced trust levels have not been manually set for the imported key.

Create a "fulcrum" directory.

```bash
mkdir ~/fulcrum
```
Create a "fulcrum_db" directory.

```bash
mkdir ~/fulcrum_db
```
Unpackage the archive.

```bash
tar xvf Fulcrum-*-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
```
Move the contents to the “fulcrum” directory.

```bash
mv Fulcrum-*-x86_64-linux/* /home/satoshi/fulcrum
```
Remove the leftover folder.

```bash
rm -r Fulcrum-*-x86_64-linux
```
Remove the archive.

```bash
rm Fulcrum-*-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
```
Remove the verification files.

```bash
rm Fulcrum-*-shasums.txt && rm Fulcrum-*-shasums.txt.asc
```
Enter the "fulcrum" directory.

```bash
cd ~/fulcrum
```
Generate a new SSL key. Hit enter on the prompts, leaving all at default.

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
```
Rename the default fulcrum configuration file.

```bash
mv fulcrum-example-config.conf fulcrum.conf
```
Open the "fulcrum.conf" file.

```bash
nano fulcrum.conf
```
Edit the following lines as shown.

```bash
####change
datadir = /path/to/a/dir  # Windows: datadir = D:\FulcrumData\mainnet

##to
datadir = /home/satoshi/fulcrum_db  # Windows: datadir = D:\FulcrumData\mainnet

####edit to your core rpc username & password
rpcuser = Bob_The_Banker
rpcpassword = hunter1

####uncomment the following line
#ssl = 0.0.0.0:50002

##like so
ssl = 0.0.0.0:50002

####uncomment & edit the following lines
#cert = /path/to/server-cert.pem
#key = /path/to/server-key.pem
#peering = true

##like so
cert = /home/satoshi/fulcrum/cert.pem
key = /home/satoshi/fulcrum/key.pem
peering = false

###uncomment & edit the following line
#fast-sync = 0

##like so
fast-sync = 2000
```
Save and exit the file.

Create a service file to start Fulcrum on system boot.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/fulcrum.service
```
Paste the following lines, then save and exit the service file.

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Fulcrum
After=network.target
[Service]
ExecStart=/home/satoshi/fulcrum/Fulcrum /home/satoshi/fulcrum/fulcrum.conf
User=satoshi
LimitNOFILE=8192
TimeoutStopSec=30min
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Enable the service file.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable fulcrum.service
```
Start Fulcrum.

```bash
sudo systemctl start fulcrum.service
```
Before continuing, wait until the Fulcrum sync has been completed. The device's power supply must remain uninterrupted during this process, or else the Fulcrum database may corrupt.

Monitor Fulcrum's sync progress using the following command from the home directory. Once the logs begin displaying the latest Mempool data, the sync has completed.

```bash
journalctl -fu fulcrum.service
```
Local wallet connections to Fulcrum are made by adding the node’s local IP and SSL port into the address field of your wallet settings, for example;

    ssl://192.168.1.100:50002

**Remote connections via Tor**

To configure Fulcrum with Tor, further lines must be added to the “torcc” file.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
```
Paste the following at the bottom of the file.

```bash
# Hidden Service Fulcrum
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_fulcrum/
HiddenServiceVersion 3
HiddenServicePort 50002 127.0.0.1:50002
```
Save and exit the file, then reload Tor.

```bash
sudo systemctl reload tor
```
Fulcrum's Tor address can be requested with the following command.

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_fulcrum/hostname
```
Remote wallet connections to the Fulcrum server can be made using the server's onion address and port number, as shown in the example.

**Updating Fulcrum**

Package updates can be monitored on the official [Fulcrum repository](https://github.com/cculianu/Fulcrum/releases).

Enter the downloads directory.

```bash
cd ~/downloads
```
Copy the URL for the latest "x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz" package and download it using "wget". The following command can be edited to include the required version number.

```bash
torsocks wget https://github.com/cculianu/Fulcrum/releases/download/v0.0.0/Fulcrum-0.0.0-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
```
Download the releases matching verification files. The following commands can be edited to include the required version number.

```bash
torsocks wget https://github.com/cculianu/Fulcrum/releases/download/v0.0.0/Fulcrum-0.0.0-shasums.txt.asc
```
```bash
torsocks wget https://github.com/cculianu/Fulcrum/releases/download/v0.0.0/Fulcrum-0.0.0-shasums.txt
```
Verify the checksum of the download.

```bash
sha256sum --ignore-missing --check Fulcrum-*-shasums.txt
```
The output should show an "ok" message, for example:- "Fulcrum-0.0.0-x86_64-linux.tar.gz: OK".

Verify the signature. Cculianu's previously imported key should show a "gpg: Good signature" message.

```bash
gpg --verify Fulcrum-*-shasums.txt.asc
```
Unpack the downloaded archive.

```bash
tar xvf Fulcrum-*-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
```
Remove the archive.

```bash
rm Fulcrum-*-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
```
Remove the verification files.

```bash
rm Fulcrum-*-shasums.txt.asc && rm Fulcrum-*-shasums.txt
```
Stop Fulcrum.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop fulcrum
```
Enter the Fulcrum directory.

```bash
cd ~/fulcrum
```
Copy existing fulcrum.conf and SSL .pem files to downloads directory.

```bash
cp key.pem cert.pem fulcrum.conf ~/downloads
```
Delete the remaining Fulcrum files.

```bash
rm -rf ./*
```
Copy the contents of your newly unpackaged archive to the Fulcrum folder.

```bash
cp -r ~/downloads/Fulcrum-*-x86_64-linux/* ~/fulcrum
```
Move the fulcrum.conf and SSL .pem files back to the Fulcrum directory.

```bash
mv ~/downloads/{key.pem,cert.pem,fulcrum.conf} ~/fulcrum
```
Remove the empty folder.

```bash
rm -rf ~/downloads/Fulcrum-*-x86_64-linux
```
Start Fulcrum.

```bash
sudo systemctl start fulcrum.service
```
Restart Tor.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart tor
```
To confirm that everything is operating as expected, check the logs with the following command.

```bash
journalctl -fu fulcrum.service
```
**Complete**
