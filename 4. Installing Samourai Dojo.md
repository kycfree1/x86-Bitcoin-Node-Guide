## Dojo Node Guide. *Part 4, Installing Samourai Dojo*.

**Prerequisites.**
 - [ ] Completed "*Dojo Node Guide*", Parts 1-3.
 
 Running a Dojo server is essential for those wanting to utilise the privacy benefits achieved through the use of Samourai Wallet’s post-mix spending tools, and, powerful Whirlpool CoinJoin implementation.

Enter the downloads directory.

```bash
cd ~/downloads
```

Download the latest version of Dojo from the official [Samourai repository](https://code.samourai.io/dojo/samourai-dojo/-/releases).

```bash
wget https://code.samourai.io/dojo/samourai-dojo/-/archive/master/samourai-dojo-master.zip
```
Unzip the downloaded archive.

```bash
unzip samourai-dojo-master.zip
```
Create a directory for Dojo.

```bash
mkdir ~/dojo-app
```
Move the unpackaged files to the new directory.

```bash
mv ~/downloads/samourai-dojo-master/* ~/dojo-app/
```
Remove the empty archive & folder.

```bash
rm -r samourai-dojo-master && rm samourai-dojo-master.zip
```
Multiple configuration files need to be edited before Dojo can be initialised.

```bash
cd ~/dojo-app/docker/my-dojo/conf/
```
Open "bitcoind.conf".

```bash
nano docker-bitcoind.conf.tpl
```
Edit as follows.

```bash
####edit to your core rpc username & password
BITCOIND_RPC_USER=dojorpc
BITCOIND_RPC_PASSWORD=dojorpcpassword

####change
BITCOIND_INSTALL=on

##to
BITCOIND_INSTALL=off

####edit to your nodes IP
BITCOIND_IP=172.28.1.5

####change
BITCOIND_RPC_PORT=28256

##to
BITCOIND_RPC_PORT=8332

####change
BITCOIND_ZMQ_RAWTXS=9501

##to
BITCOIND_ZMQ_RAWTXS=28333

####change
BITCOIND_ZMQ_BLK_HASH=9502

##to
BITCOIND_ZMQ_BLK_HASH=28334
```
Save and exit the file.

Open "indexer.conf".

```bash
nano docker-indexer.conf.tpl
```
Edit as follows.

```bash
####change
INDEXER_TYPE=addrindexrs

##to
INDEXER_TYPE=fulcrum

####edit to your nodes IP
INDEXER_IP=172.28.1.6

####change
INDEXER_RPC_PORT=50001

##to
INDEXER_RPC_PORT=50002

####change
INDEXER_BATCH_SUPPORT=inactive

##to
INDEXER_BATCH_SUPPORT=active

####change
INDEXER_PROTOCOL=tcp

##to
INDEXER_PROTOCOL=tls
```
Save and exit the file.

Open "mysql.conf". 

```bash
nano docker-mysql.conf.tpl
```
Create root and user passwords for mysql, then edit the file as follows.

```bash
####edit lines with passwords
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword
MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
```
Save and exit the file.

Open "node.conf".

```bash
nano docker-node.conf.tpl
```
Create "api", "admin" and "jwt" passwords, then edit the file as follows.

```bash
####add passwords here
NODE_API_KEY=myApiKey
NODE_ADMIN_KEY=myAdminKey
NODE_JWT_SECRET=myJwtSecret

####change
NODE_ACTIVE_INDEXER=local_bitcoind

##to
NODE_ACTIVE_INDEXER=local_indexer

####optional - add paynym address if enabaling auth47
NODE_PAYMENT_CODE=
```
Save and exit the file.

Theres also the choice to disable the default Bitcoin RPC Explorer. This is optional but with an already active Mempool installation, it may not have a usecase for some. Skip this next step if wanting to leave RPC Explorer enabled.

Open "explorer.conf".

```bash
nano docker-explorer.conf.tpl
```
Edit the file as folllows to disable RPC Explorer.

```bash
####change
EXPLORER_INSTALL=on

##to
EXPLORER_INSTALL=off
```
Save and exit the file.

**Dojo Initialisation**

Enter the Dojo install script  directory.

```bash
cd ~/dojo-app/docker/my-dojo
```
Run the script.

```bash
./dojo.sh install
```
Dojo will begin the installation process. Once a constant stream of “node.js” logs appear, the installation is complete. Exit the logs with “control+c“.

The Dojo Maintenance Tool, or "DMT", is accessible only via Tor. The servers dedicated onion address can be requested with the following command.

```bash
./dojo.sh onion
```
The DMT can be accessed via this onion address, and logged into using either the "admin key" previously created, or via "Auth47" if previously configured. 

Once a full house of green ticks shows on the dashboard, Dojo is synched, and is ready for pairing with a [Samourai Wallet](https://samouraiwallet.com/).

Select "pairing" from the DMT's menu to display the pairing QR code that can be scanned during a [Samourai Wallet's setup process](https://docs.samourai.io/wallet/new-wallet#dojo). If the RPC explorer was not disabled, two QR codes will be displayed. The Dojo pairing QR is the one to the left.

#### Installing Whirlpool CLI

Create a directory for Whirlpool.

```bash
mkdir ~/whirlpool
```
Enter the directory.

```bash
cd ~/whirlpool
```
Visit the Whirlpool CLI [release page](https://code.samourai.io/whirlpool/whirlpool-client-cli/-/releases) and copy the link for the latest “run.jar” file, downloading it with “wget”. At time of writing, the latest version is 0.10.16, so modify commands accordingly.

```bash
wget https://code.samourai.io/whirlpool/whirlpool-client-cli/uploads/63621e145967f536a562851853bd0990/whirlpool-client-cli-0.10.16-run.jar
```
Install Java.

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre openjdk-17-jdk -y
```
Before initialising Whirlpool, have the Samourai Wallet’s passphrase and pairing code ready for pasting into the terminal. The pairing code is found in Samourai Wallet under Settings > Transaction > Pair to Whirlpool GUI.

Initiate Whirlpool, entering the pairing code and passphrase when prompted.

```bash
java -jar whirlpool-client-cli-0.10.16-run.jar --init
```
It may take a minute to connect, but once logs start printing for the wallets postmix account, pairing is successfull. If returned to command prompt, pairing has failed, and will need to be rerun until successful.

Once paired, exit the logs with "control+c"

Create a system file to start Whirlpool on boot.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/whirlpool.service
```
Paste the following lines, ensuring to edit if Whirlpool version differs.

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Whirlpool
After=tor.service
[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/satoshi/whirlpool
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar whirlpool-client-cli-0.10.16-run.jar --server=mainnet --tor --auto-mix --mixs-target=0 --listen
User=satoshi
Group=satoshi
Type=simple
KillMode=process
TimeoutSec=60
Restart=always
RestartSec=60
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Save and exit the file.

Reload "systemctl".

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
Enable the Whirlpool service.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable whirlpool
```
Start the Whirlpool service.

```bash
sudo systemctl start whirlpool
```
Whirlpool CLI is now operational.

If preferring to use Whirlpool via a grapical user interface, rather than command line, Samourai has provided users with a Whirlpool GUI, which can be [downloaded from their website](https://samouraiwallet.com/download).

Upon opening the GUI for the first time, "Remote CLI" should be selected. 

In the CLI Address field, replace "my-cli-host" with your nodes IP.

Next, select "Configure API Key", and a box will appear. To find the key, return to the terminal and run the following command.

```bash
nano ~/whirlpool/whirlpool-cli-config.properties
```
Once the CLI and API addresses are entered, select "Connect". 

After a few seconds a prompt will appear requesting the wallets passphrase. Once entered the pairing is complete.
