## Dojo Node Guide. *Part 3, Installing Mempool Explorer*.

**Prerequisites.**
 - [ ] Completed "*Dojo Node Guide*", Parts 1-2.

The Mempool Visual Explorer is a valuable tool for looking up detailed information about blocks, addresses, balances & transactions.

It’s preferable to host your own instance locally instead of entering personal transaction details into websites you don’t control.

Before installing Mempool, Docker is required.

Download the Docker install script.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
```
Run the installation script.

```bash
sudo sh ./get-docker.sh
```
Add the user to the docker group.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker satoshi
```
Log out.

```bash
exit
```
Log back in as "satoshi" again. This re-evaluates the users new membership to the Docker group.

**Install Mempool**

Clone the Mempool repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mempool/mempool.git
```
Enter the Mempool Docker directory.

```bash
cd mempool/docker
```
Open the “docker-compose.yml” file.

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```
Edit the following lines.

```bash
####change
ports:
  - 80:8080

##to
ports:
  - 4080:8080

####change
MEMPOOL_BACKEND: "none"

##to
MEMPOOL_BACKEND: "electrum"

####edit to your nodes local ip
CORE_RPC_HOST: "172.27.0.1"

####edit to your core rpc username & password
CORE_RPC_USERNAME: "mempool"
CORE_RPC_PASSWORD: "mempool"

####change all 3 instances of
restart: on-failure

##to
restart: always
```
Add the following lines below “STATISTICS_ENABLED”, editing "ELECTRUM_HOST" to include the nodes local ip.

```bash
ELECTRUM_HOST: "192.xxx.x.xx"
ELECTRUM_PORT: "50002"
ELECTRUM_TLS_ENABLED: "true"
```
Paste the following block at the bottom of the file, on the next available free line. Ensure the spacing is exactly as shown.

```bash
networks:
  default:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.16.57.0/24
```
Save and exit the file.

Now initialise Mempool.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Open a web browser and in the address bar type your nodes ip address, followed by ":4080" to visit the local Mempool instance.

As a fresh install, it may take time before Mempool fully populates., so don’t be concerned if the dashboard is incomplete to begin with.

**Remote Connections via Tor**

The local Mempool installation can be accessed from anywhere in the world using a [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/). A unique onion address is required for this functionailty.

Open the "torrc" file

```bash
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
```
Add the following lines to the bottom of the file, then save and exit.

```bash
# Hidden Service Mempool
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/mempool/
HiddenServiceVersion 3
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:4080
```
Restart the Tor service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart tor
```
Mempool's Tor address can be requested with the following command.

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/tor/mempool/hostname
```
